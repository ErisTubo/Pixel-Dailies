# Hi!
Nice too meet cha!
I'm Eris and I do pixel art from time to time :) you can see my recent updates on my [Twitter](https://twitter/eristubo) or on my [Blog](https://eristubo.github.io) where I post even more pixels and codes.

# Pixel-Dailies
Pixel Dailies is a pixel art group that started on twitter in mid 2014. Based on the successful art group Sketch Dailies, Pixel Dailies (PD) is a place for people to practise their pixel art by doing pixel art every day. Under such huge time constraints, you can’t afford to endlessly iterate on a piece, rather you just have to get it done and move on to the next day.

PD has allowed me to meet other pixel artist enthusiasts from around the world. The contributors to PD vary hugely in ability but we’re a friendly and supportive bunch. The themes are different every day and we try to cover all the interesting keywords.

This is a boiler plate from the official [homepage](https://bp.io/pd) but its the same depiction of my own opinion :relaxed:
Join us in making pixels everyday. You are also welcome on our [Discord](http://discord.gg/T9Puddm): http://discord.gg/T9Puddm .

# What is this?!
This repository functions as a backup and database for me and my various projects.
I've open it to the public so you may use it freely without any constrains but commercial use. See license [GPL3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) .

You need [Asesprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) to use the files.
As for the pictures they are mostly saved as .gifs or .png and can be open by most softwares.

# How to
Each folder has contains 8 files:
```
pd000.ase           Main Asesprite file. Can be 64x64, 128x128 or 256x256
```
```
pd000tiny.gif       64x64.gif
pd000small.gif      128x128.gif
pd000big.gif        256x256.gif
```
```
pd000twitter.ase    Include frame and palette. 506x506, perfect for the Twitter wall
pd000twitter.ase    506x506.gif
```
```
pd000palette.ase    colorspalette.png
```
```
README.md           Contains various meta keys, values and links to all social sites I uploaded to.
```
On new PDs, I open a new canvas in Asesprite of the size 64x64/128x128/256x256, which ever fits the image I want to convey. Mostly 64x64 base because for pd000small.gif and pd000big.gif I will not lose quality on upscalling.
But you will find some of these images were made in 128x128 or even in 256x256. Those files have very bad smaller sized gifs but its okay for thumbnails I guess.

# To do
See [PD Projects](https://github.com/ErisTubo/Pixel-Dailies/projects) for overall progress.


# But why?!
I'm doing this to get better at pixel art for various reasons :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
