# Template & Workflow
Workflow image shows how to use the template for posting purposes.

There are 2 templates to be used in numeric order.
Create PD first in Template-1 as it original size. After saving, resize and copy to Template-2 to fit a Twitter post.

This is to ensure that twitter doesn't stretch the gif width and height to the default twitter post and therefor makes a small gif blurry.
As for normal PD image files and not gif files Twitter will not stretch but this should keep every post to the same format.

# To Do
- [ ] Workflow isn't as visualize. Update workflow picture.
- [ ] Fix Twitter not looping right. See 001 (Twitter post) for example.
