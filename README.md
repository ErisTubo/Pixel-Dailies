# Pixel-Dailies
Pixel Dailies files and pictures including templates and workflow.
You need Asesprite to use the files. As for the pictures they are mostly safed as gifs or png.

# Template & Workflow
There are Template-1 & Template-2 in the root folder.

Heres an example how I use these if theres a PD coming.
1. Open Template-1 with Asesprite and saved under 'number-theme-date-title-1.ase' in folder 'number'.
2. Create raw image or animation in that file.
3. When finish save this version resize it 2 times by 200% and copy whole layers and frames to Template-2.
4. Save Template-2 as 'number-theme-date-title-2.ase' in the same folder as the first file.
5. Undo resizing of the first file.
6. Draw title theme and color palette in the second file.
7. Save and also export second file as gif.
8. Update GitHub repository, create short URL from the new folder and post!

This is to ensure that twitter doesn't stretch the gif width and height to the default twitter post and therefor makes a small gif blurry.
As for normal PD image files and not gif files Twitter will not stretch but this should keep every post to the same format.
